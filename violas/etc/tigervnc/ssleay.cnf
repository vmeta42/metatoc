# This openssl configuration file is used to auto generate a self signed
# certificate for the -X509Cert and -X509Key options of the Xtigervnc server.
# The magic @HostName@ value is substituted by the fully qualified domain name
# of the machine. The openssl command used to auto generate the certificate is
# specified in /etc/vnc.conf with the $sslAutoGenCertCommand option.
#
# If the user wants their own certificate, instead of the on demand auto
# generated one, they can either specify it via the -X509Cert and -X509Key
# options to tigervncserver or replaces the auto generated files
# ~/.vnc/${HOSTFQDN}-SrvCert.pem and ~/.vnc/${HOSTFQDN}-SrvKey.pem in their
# home directory. These files will not be overwritten once generated by the
# tigervncserver wrapper script.
